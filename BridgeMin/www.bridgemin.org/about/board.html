    <p class="p-heading">Natalie Higashiyama </p>
    <p> A golden fall day in 1992 at the Pike Place Market lured  Natalie Higashiyama, a new bride, and her husband, from the Midwest to the  Pacific Northwest. With their three children, they reside in Sammamish.  Natalie’s first home was a formal classroom where she taught in private, public  and community college settings.  But the  classroom of life has proven to be a far more life-changing opportunity as  Natalie raises her adult daughter with multiple disabilities. Using her English  degrees, she invokes the power of the written and spoken word to advocate in  the medical, educational, housing, and legislative worlds.  She believes that people are precious,  including our DD community and deserve a flourishing life. Through her  parenting of an individual with disabilities, she continues to learn that the  weakest among us enable the strong among us to welcome our own vulnerability.  To continue to find the strength to fight for the respect, support and human  dignity our most vulnerable deserve, Natalie can be found on any given Sunday  worshipping and volunteering in her local church. Natalie joined the Bridge Ministries Board of Directors March 1, 2015.<br />
